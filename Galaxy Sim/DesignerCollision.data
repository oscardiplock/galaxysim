Designer Stellar Cluster
========================

Design your own personal stellar cluster!
Imagine N=200 or so globular clusters in a local cluster approximating a small galaxy

Edit the following left-hand entries...

  500     Total number of bodies

  300     Number of bodies in one galaxy

  290     Time steps

  50.0    Set the initial size of your cluster in Parsecs (pc).

  0.25    Set the thickness of your cluster relative to its diameter.

  1.00    Gravity strength factor.  Change the strength of gravity.

  1.0e6   Mass of a Globular Cluster.  Try 1 million solar masses.

  10.0    Globular Cluster core radius in Parsecs (pc).

  20.0     Time step in kilo-years.

  1.01    Velocity factor.  Change the initial velocities by this factor.

  45.0   -20.0  20.0  Ordered rotation angles about the x, then y, then z axes.

  0.0    45.0  20.0  Rotation angles for second galaxy

  300.0  0.0  0.0   Displacement vector between galaxies

  -1.0   0.0  0.0   Relative galaxy velocity (direction only)

  0.1     Galaxy speed

  .true.  Spin the view.
