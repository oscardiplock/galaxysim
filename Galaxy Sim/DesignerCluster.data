Designer Stellar Cluster
========================

Design your own personal stellar cluster!
Imagine N=200 or so globular clusters in a local cluster approximating a small galaxy

Edit the following left-hand entries...

  50.0    Set the initial size of your cluster in Parsecs (pc).

  0.25    Set the thickness of your cluster relative to its diameter.

  1.00    Gravity strength factor.  Change the strength of gravity.

  1.0e6   Mass of a Globular Cluster.  Try 1 million solar masses.

  10.0    Globular Cluster core radius in Parsecs (pc).

   5.0    Time step in kilo-years.

  1.01    Velocity factor.  Change the initial velocities by this factor.

  45.0   0.0  20.0  Ordered rotation angles about the x, then y, then z axes.

  .true.  Spin the view.
